# Dungeon Defenders Eternity Linux Fixes

A fix for Dungeon Defenders Eternity not working on Linux. I have tested it against my own Debian Jessie setup 
but it should work for any Linux OS.

# How to use it

First you need to download the script:
- [Download](https://github.com/bubylou/dundeflinuxfix/archive/master.zip)

Unzip the file either from your file manager or using this command:
```
unzip dundeflinuxfix-master.zip
```

Next you need to make sure the script is executable:
```
cd dundeflinuxfix-master
chmod +x fix.sh
```

Now you can run it:
```
./fix.sh

```
